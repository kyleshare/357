Note: Read the loops and conditionals examples before this.

Ex: Track how many times a user has been greeted, print an initial greeting the first time the user is greeted,
and a different greeting the following times. Ask the user how many times the program should greet them.

first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
times_greeted=0

echo "How many times should I greet you?"
read greeting_limit

while [ $times_greeted -lt $greeting_limit ]
do
  if [ $times_greeted -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
  
  times_greeted=$((times_greeted + 1))
done
