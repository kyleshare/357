Another eay to access external data is to have a user add input arguments when they run your script

Within the script, they're accessed using $1, $2, etc.
An indefinite number of input arguments can be accessed with $@

Ex: Write a script to print all input arguments

for arg in $@
do
  echo $arg
done
