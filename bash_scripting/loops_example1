Bash scripting uses 3 types of loops, for, while, & until.
Until loops until a condition is true, whereas while loops while a condition is true.

Ex: Print the var index as long as it is less than 5, incrementing it each time

#Using while
while [ $index -lt 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index = $((index + 1))
done

#Using until
until [ $index -ge 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index = $((index + 1))
done



Notes: 
Arithmetic in bash scripting uses $((...)) syntax.
