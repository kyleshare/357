Note: Review loops, conditionals, and input before aliases.

We can call scripts without specifying the full name by using aliases.
For OSX, aliases will be set in our .bash_profile
Normally, a script name such as "script.sh" is called by typing ./script.sh

Ex: Use an alias to make our script easier to call.

greet="./script.sh"


Now we just run greet to call our script.
We can also add input arguments to our alias.

Ex:  Create an alias called greet3 that will run our script "script.sh" and greet the user 3 times. 

greet3="./script.sh 3" 

first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
times_greeted=0
greeting_limit=$1

while [ times_greeted -lt greeting_limit ]
do
  ...


Note: 
Remember that creating an alias happens in .bash_profile, while the script itself is in a .sh file.
If the input argument is a string place it inside " "
