Print the var index as long as it is less than 5, incrementing it each time

#Using while
while [ $index -lt 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index = $((index + 1))
done

#Using until
until [ $index -ge 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index = $((index + 1))
done



Notes: 
Loops use "do" and "done"
Arithmetic in bash scripting uses $((...)) syntax.
